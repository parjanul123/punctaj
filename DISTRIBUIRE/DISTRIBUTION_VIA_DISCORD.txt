⚠️ IMPORTANT: Unsigned Application Notice
==========================================

This application is unsigned (no digital certificate) because:
- It's a personal/group project (non-commercial)
- Digital certificates cost money
- Windows SmartScreen may warn about it
- This is NORMAL for personal projects shared among friends

This does NOT mean the application is malicious. It's just not signed by a company.


🚀 HOW TO DISTRIBUTE VIA DISCORD
=================================

Step 1: Get the ZIP file
   Location: Punctaj_Manager_v2.0.0_Setup.zip
   Size: ~20 MB
   Contains: Everything needed to install

Step 2: Upload to Discord
   1. Open Discord
   2. Go to your group/server
   3. Click attachment button 📎
   4. Select: Punctaj_Manager_v2.0.0_Setup.zip
   5. Send message with explanation (see below)

Step 3: Tell your friends
   Send this message in Discord:

   ---
   📦 Punctaj Manager v2.0.0 Setup
   
   This is a personal application for our team.
   It's unsigned because it's not a commercial product.
   
   **Installation:**

   2. Extract it (right-click > Extract All)
   3. Run: install.bat (double-click)
   4. Click "Yes" when Windows asks for admin

   6. Done! Desktop shortcut created
   
   **If Windows shows warning:**
   1. Click "More info"
   2. Click "Run anyway"

   ---


⚠️ WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN WARNING
==============================

When friends run install.bat, they might see:

"Windows Defender SmartScreen protected your PC
This app couldn't be verified by a trusted publisher."

This is NORMAL for unsigned apps. It's not a virus!

How to bypass it:
   1. Click "More info" button
   2. Click "Run anyway" button
   3. Installation continues normally

Why does this happen?
   - No digital certificate (costs $300+)
   - Windows doesn't recognize the publisher
   - Happens with all unsigned apps


✅ ZIP vs EXE - Why ZIP is better
=================================

DON'T distribute: punctaj.exe directly
   ❌ Windows will block it
   ❌ Discord might warn users
   ❌ SmartScreen will definitely warn

DO distribute: Punctaj_Manager_v2.0.0_Setup.zip
   ✅ ZIP files are safe
   ✅ Discord won't block it
   ✅ Users extract and run install.bat
   ✅ install.bat (batch file) is trusted
   ✅ Fewer warnings

🚨 IF WINDOWS SHOWS A WARNING
=============================

Sometimes Windows shows:

"Windows Defender SmartScreen can't be reached.
The app can't be verified."

Or:

"Windows protected your PC
This app couldn't be verified by a trusted publisher."

What to do:
   1. Click: "More info"
   2. Click: "Run anyway"
   3. Installation continues
   4. Perfectly safe!

Why? Because the app is unsigned.
It's like: "I don't recognize this publisher, but if you trust them, go ahead."


📊 WHAT GETS INSTALLED
======================

Installation folder: C:\Program Files\Punctaj\
   • Punctaj_Manager.exe (main application)
   • discord_config.ini (Discord settings)
   • supabase_config.ini (Database settings)
   • Encryption key (auto-generated)
   • Data folders (logs, data, backups)

Start Menu: Punctaj Manager
Desktop: Punctaj Manager shortcut
Uninstaller: Control Panel > Uninstall Programs

❓ COMMON QUESTIONS
===================

Q: Is it really safe?
A: Yes! It's just unsigned because it's personal/non-commercial.
   No virus, no malware, no data theft.

Q: Why does Windows warn me?
A: Because there's no digital certificate from a company.
   Certificates cost money and are for commercial apps.

Q: Can I ignore the warning?
A: Yes! Click "Run anyway" to proceed.
   If you trust the person who sent it, it's safe.

Q: Why ZIP instead of EXE?
A: ZIP is safer for distribution and Discord allows it.
   Running install.bat from ZIP is trusted by Windows.

Q: Can I share it with others?
A: Yes! Share the ZIP file with your friends.
   They follow the same installation steps.

Q: Will it collect my data?
A: No! It syncs employee data to YOUR Supabase database.
   All data is encrypted and stays under your control.


🔐 SECURITY NOTES
=================

✅ Source code is personal/non-commercial
✅ No telemetry or data collection
✅ All data encrypted with AES-256
